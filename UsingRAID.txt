We got two RAID servers in our lab.

batan.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br
sumatra.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br

The RAID is configured in the /RAID directory in both of them. 
We recomment to upload your important stuff to these directories ASAP!!

In order to copy some directory from your machine to one raid, use the following
command:

rsync -Cravpe ssh your_directory lbduser@batan.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br:/RAID/your_name

example:
local_machine$ ls
dir1/     dir2/
local_machine$ rsync -Cravpe ssh dir1 lbduser@batan.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br:/RAID/joao
